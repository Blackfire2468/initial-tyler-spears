I’m Tyler Spears, and I’m 20 years old. I go to Georgetown College in Scott County, where I’m majoring in Art and minoring in Computer Science. I’m really like graphic design and want to work in the design field or open my own print shop after college. I like to be creative and bring ideas to life.

I’m also Adobe Illustrator certified, which has helped me in my design work. I enjoy learning new design techniques and exploring different creative styles.

Outside of school, I stay pretty active and social. I have played pickleball over the past few years and i have even won two tournaments. When I’m not playing pickleball i'm ussally playing viedo games or hanging out with my friends or my girlfriend if i'm not doing that then i'm most likly at work or school. I have three dogs named Sheba, Buddy and Cooper and a bird named kiwi.

I have also done quite a bit of traveling across the U.S.. I’ve been to places like Yellowstone, Niagara Falls, and Florida, but my favorite trip so far was definitely Discovery Cove in Florida, where I got to swim with dolphins which has been an unforgettable experience.

I have also worked at Penn Station for about three years, and I’m currently a manager there. I handle most of the everyday operations, solve problems on the fly, and help train new team members. It’s taught me a lot about leadership, teamwork, and communication.

I’m proud to be an Eagle Scout and also completed NYLT (National Youth Leadership Training) through Boy Scouts, which helped me develop strong leadership and problem-solving skills that I carry into school, work, and everyday life.

Thank you for reading my get to know me if you care to learn more about other stuff i have done i have articles and links to the things i like.
