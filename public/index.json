I’m really like graphic design and want to work in the design field or open my own print shop after college. I like to be creative and bring ideas to life.\nI’m also Adobe Illustrator certified, which has helped me in my design work. I enjoy learning new design techniques and exploring different creative styles.\nOutside of school, I stay pretty active and social. I have played pickleball over the past few years and i have even won two tournaments. When I’m not playing pickleball i\u0026rsquo;m ussally playing viedo games or hanging out with my friends or my girlfriend if i\u0026rsquo;m not doing that then i\u0026rsquo;m most likly at work or school. I have three dogs named Sheba, Buddy and Cooper and a bird named kiwi.\nI have also done quite a bit of traveling across the U.S.. I’ve been to places like Yellowstone, Niagara Falls, and Florida, but my favorite trip so far was definitely Discovery Cove in Florida, where I got to swim with dolphins which has been an unforgettable experience.\nI have also worked at Penn Station for about three years, and I’m currently a manager there. I handle most of the everyday operations, solve problems on the fly, and help train new team members. It’s taught me a lot about leadership, teamwork, and communication.\nI’m proud to be an Eagle Scout and also completed NYLT (National Youth Leadership Training) through Boy Scouts, which helped me develop strong leadership and problem-solving skills that I carry into school, work, and everyday life.\nThank you for reading my get to know me if you care to learn more about other stuff i have done i have articles and links to the things i like.\nAddtional Information\rWant to know more about pickleball rules Click Here.\rInterseted in becoming a boy scout or knowing about ranks Click Here.\rWant to know more about where I work or hungry for a meal Click Here.","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/aboutme/","section":"Abouts","summary":"\u003chtml\u003e\r\n  \u003cstyle\u003e\r\n button {\r\n      background-color: #0078d7;\r\n      color: white;\r\n      border: none;\r\n      padding: 10px 20px;\r\n      margin-top: 10px;\r\n      border-radius: 4px;\r\n      cursor: pointer;\r\n    }\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/style\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m Tyler Spears, and I’m 20 years old.

At each position of the grid there is either a space or a \"#\" character. The characters should form a chessboard. Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:\r# # # # # # # # # # # #\r# # # # # # # #\r# # # # # # # #\r# # # #\rWhen you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.\rMy Answer\rExplanation of how the code works below\nHere’s some interactive code you can try to test it out:\nlet size = 8;\rlet board = \"\";\rfor (let y = 0; y \u003c size; y++) {\rfor (let x = 0; x \u003c size; x++) {\rif ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {\rboard += \" \";\r} else {\rboard += \"#\";}\r}\rif (y Run Code\rlet size = 8; let board = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo;; for (let y = 0; y \u0026lt; size; y++) { for (let x = 0; x \u0026lt; size; x++) { if ((x + y) % 2 == 0) { board += \u0026quot; \u0026ldquo;; } else { board += \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo;;} } if (y \u0026lt; size - 1) board += \u0026ldquo;\\n\u0026rdquo;; } console.log(board) Explanation\rIn order to explain the code we will take it line by line:\rlet size = 8; this determines the size of the board so in this case it would be an 8x8 board if we changed the number to 9 it would become a 9x9 board and so on as that number changes.\rlet board = \"\";\rThis makes the board as a string that can be printed out. This allows the board start with empty characters.\rfor (let y = 0; y \u003c size; y++) {\rthis for loop then makes y equal 0 which is like a y-axis on a graph so row 1 gets created then it checks to make sure that y is less than the size that we made the board so in this case y has to be less than 8. Then at the end of this for loop it adds 1 to the y to tell it to go down a row.\rfor (let x = 0; x \u003c size; x++) {\rthis for loop that is in the previous for loop make x equal 0 similar to the other loop with y this does the columns instead of the rows and in order to keep it a square it also has to check to make sure that x is less than the size. after that it adds one to the x and goes until it hits 8 at that point it returns to the previous for loop and does it all again.\rif ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {\rthis if statement says that if x and y added together are divisible by 2 meaning that if x is 5 and y is 7 then that would be 12 then it would divide until the remainder is either 1 or 0 in this case if the value is 0 then it would do the statement below otherwise it will go to the else.\rboard += \" \";\rthis is the statement that if x and y added are divisible by 2 then it will make that spot on the board a blank meaning a space or no character.\r} else {\rboard += \"#\";}\rthis else statement says is if the previous statement is not true and x plus y can not be divided by 2 then it is going to make a # on the board.\r}\rif (y \u003c size - 1) board += \"\\n\";}\rthis if statement is outside of the second loop but in the first one and this makes the new lines for the board so when the y and x are done with the row they are on this will make a new line this stops before the end as you do not need a new line after the final row.\rconsole.log(board)\rthis just produces the code somewhere the viewer can see it so you know it actually works.\rSources\rClick Here for the link to the textbook for this problem.\rClick Here for the link to the theme for blowfish on github.","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/articles/problem1/homework1/","section":"Welcome to Articles","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe first problem we are going to look at is one from the chaper two homework.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eChessBoard\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\u003cblockquote\u003e Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines.
